##Testing

###Unit Testing

```npm test```

-- opens up the unit testing suite and starts watching for new tests, and passing them

###End To End Testing (Functional Testing)

Install protractor and its webdriver first (this is really large and will take awhile)

```[sudo] npm run update-webdriver```


Then run the webserver

```npm start```

Then run the end to end test launcher

```npm run protractor```
